# Michaelis-Menten-Kinetics-Models
Python source code for generating Michaelis-Menten and Lineweaver-Burke plots from recorded concentration and absorbance data. 

Specifically characterizes purified YqhD alcohol dehydrogenase found in isobutanol biosynthetic pathway (branching off of valine synthesis pathway in bacteria). Specific reaction was reduction of prpionaldehyde to propanol (NADPH used as reducing agent and as proxy for reacton rate based on absorbance at 340 nm). Three cases examined; no inhibitor, 4-Methylpyrazole ('4M'), and EDTA ('ED'). The following plots and data are generated:
